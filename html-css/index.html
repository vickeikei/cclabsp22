        <b> Course Description </b>
        <br>
        Creative Coding Lab explores the fundamentals of computer programming and web development through a series of
        creative projects. The course aims to equip students with the skills to develop web-based applications that use
        the
        JavaScript language and the p5.js environment and include a significant computational component. Fundamental
        concepts, such as variables, functions, control flow, arrays, loops and object-oriented programming, are applied
        to
        create generative visuals, interactive experiences, and internet art projects. This course is intended for
        students
        with no prior programming experience.
