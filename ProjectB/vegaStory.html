        <div id = "text1-container"><p> Once upon a time, seven fairy sisters lived among the clouds in heaven. One day, after obtaining permission from the Empress of the Skies, they take a trip to the mortal world.</p></div>
        <div id = "text2-container"><p> They splashed in the river, picked flowers for their hair, and ran with the forest animals. They were enjoying the mortal realm and found everything to be interesting. </p> </div>
        <div id = "text3-container"><p> All of a sudden, they found that their flower crowns were gone. Realizing that a mortal man had stolen them, they elected their youngest sister, a weaver known as Vega, to retrieve it back.</p> </div>
        <div id = "text4-container"><p> Vega approached the man, and demanded the flower crowns back. He makes a deal with her: heâ€™ll return the flowers if she accompanies him to the Moon festival. </p> </div>
        <div id = "text5-container"><p> She agrees, and after being in his company, she realizes that she has fallen in love with him. Vega decides to stay in the mortal realm and marries Altair. </p> </div>
        <div id = "text6-container"><p> After many years of living in the mortal realm, the Empress finds out about this atrocity. She becomes angry and orders Vega to return to heaven at once. Vega is saddened that she has to leave her love, so she returns to heaven and resumes her former task of weaving silk clouds.</p> </div>
        <div id = "text7-container"><p> One day, Altair appears in the sky. She tells him how much she missed him and tries to hide him from the wrath of the Empress. However, this was soon interrupted by the fury of the Empress. </p> </div>
